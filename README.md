# Waiter-Bot
Automated a 4-wheel mobile robot using C++, to perform localization, using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and gyroscope to navigate through a room detecting and taking orders from students before delivering food to them at their original locations. Performed path planning by establishing robust and versatile data structures to store robot route instructions and order data, optimizing iterative algorithms to read-in stored data and generate optimal robot trajectory. Accurately delivered 92% of orders within a 50cm2 margin of error from initial order location, to students in 17 locations.

The main code is located in main.cpp while a sample text file containing the robot route instructions is located in sample_instructions.txt .
